# About

This is a sample solution in which the WPF client app consumes the WCF service in order to show data using a DevXGrid and to allow to insert/update/delete data in the SQL Server.


# Set up your environment

The database used in this sample app can be found in the database folder.

SQL connection string will need to be updated to be able to access the SQL server running on your machine. SQL connection string can be found at WcfServiceHost project --> Configurations folder --> Service.config file.
